# LSTM-Based Trading Strategy

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based machine learning model to develop and test a predictive trading strategy. The notebook guides users through the key stages of building an AI-powered trading model, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model design, and performance evaluation.
